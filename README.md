Very basic build system, basically just an experiment. Writing a simple shell script and a justfile is much easier.

Use this if you want
- your build system to be in lua
- to not have to rely on external lua libraries
- to be quirky

Q: What benifits does this have?<br>
Probably easier to port your build scripts to Windows, maybe. But I dont think Windows users care much about this, as they have Visual Studio to manage their projects. And those who dont use VS probably use WSL.

Q: Do you use this yourself?<br>
I did, until the code for this was more than the code required to enable paging on RISC-V and then I switched to using a shell script.

Q: You should have used lisp if you care about SLOC<br>
